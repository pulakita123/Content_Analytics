# Overview
This project analyzes how a digital content library has evolved over time using an interactive analytics dashboard. The goal is to provide clear visibility into long-term trends in content growth, format distribution, and geographic contribution, enabling stakeholders to move from assumption-based decisions to evidence-based insights.
The project follows a Business Analyst–driven approach, starting from business problem identification and requirement definition, and ending with measurable insights delivered through data visualization.

# Business Problems
Limited visibility into year-by-year growth of the content library
Difficulty understanding how the balance between movies and series has changed over time
Lack of clarity around geographic and genre-level contribution
Static reports that do not support exploratory analysis

# Business Questions
How has the content library grown over the years?
Is there a visible shift in content format across time?
Which countries and genres contribute most to new content?
How do content trends change when filtered by time or geography?

# KPIs Defined
